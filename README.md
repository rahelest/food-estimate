## About

The aim of this project is to provide an easy way to know if I have bought enough food from the store. 
It takes into account the daily grams and calculates for how long the food should last.
It warns if something will expire. For example, if I eat 1kg per day and buy 3kg of meat with tomorrow as the expiration date, it will let me know.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
